# BattleShip

Welcome to an imperfectly perfect attempt on our concerted effort to recreate the classically beloved, yet vaguely patriarchal family game of BattleShip!
We have drawn out and built a playable game for your enjoyment!**
The game allows for an individual human player to play against an illogical, inferior, and completely randomized computer player.

Both players will be given their own 4 x 4 cell board; Thus providing 16 total cells to clandestinely place both a single cruiser (occupying 3 cells), as well as a single submarine (occupying 2 cells). Please note that both ships can only be placed horizontally and vertically, and not diagonally. Additionally, each ship placement may only be numerically ascending (i.e. 1...2...3), and alphabetically descending (i.e. A...B...C). 

Please enjoy and good luck!


 **Current game play does not allow for first move from player. Please do be aware of and appreciate the gaming experience up to that point of failure.
